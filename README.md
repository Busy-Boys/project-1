## About

moovie.pro is a film search engine for curating collections and comparing data. On top of standard features in this category, the site contains many useful tools including a built-in inflation calculator, which enables direct comparisons between modern and classic films, and a success metric based on profit. The feature causing the most excitement is the additional information on where to watch searched films. The site highlights which streaming services currently feature the titles being browsed, and provides the per-month cost of each listed service.
